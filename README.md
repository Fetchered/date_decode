# Date Decode
A timestamp and date decoder written in python 2.x

I noticed a lack of timestamp conversion utilities in a number of different linux systems. Since I happen to use linux in my day-to-day work I thought this would help.
I took a small part of the formatting for this from the Packt Publishing Learning Python for Forensics, but the rest of this was my own machination.

This was developed with the Digital Forensics field in mind, so all of the testing has been done with the up-to-date SIFT Kit from SANS.
If you have any questions, suggestions, helpful thoughts of any kind, please feel free to drop me a line.

Note: You will notice several commented sections in the existing code. I am working on adding the capability of converting a formatted Date/Time to the timestamp of your choice. It is still a work in progress.
